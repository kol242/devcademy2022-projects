# Week Two Assignment

## Stakeholder:

In Week One Assignment you create some awesome components. Now it's time to go deeper in web development. Let's make the components functional and adapt styles in all components. 

Also, I want to see the search forms in the application as well as the accommodation booking form.

## Assignments:

First you need to adapt styles in your current components by design guideline in Figma, please check [Landing page](https://www.figma.com/file/1kvW5E4L0n5hTryNuLUTN5/Booking-Web?node-id=36%3A8405). 
Let's create new component `Home.tsx` in which you will display the components for landing page.
For `View All Locations` and `View All Homes` links to work, you'll need to create two more components. Now create new components `Locations.tsx`*	and `Favorites.tsx`*. By clicking on one of the links you need to change the `Home` component with the corresponding component.

Now itâ€™s time to make a component for other link on landing page:
- `MyPlaces.tsx`*
- `MyBookings.tsx`*

**new components should contain only the title*

Implement logic for the rest of the link on landing page.

If you remember, we have a button on the page with the details of the accommodation, it is necessary to make the button functional. To do this, create the `Reservation.tsx` component. The component should contain reservation form and the card with accommodation details. You can name the form as `ReservationForm.tsx`**. To the right of the form is a card, name it `ReservationCard.tsx`

In order for our application to be fully functional, we need forms. Create a new component to filter accommodation from landing page, you can call it `AccommodationSearch.tsx`. **

Create three more forms** (check design section for form location):
- `SimpleSearch.tsx`
- `AdvancedSearch.tsx`

Display forms within the corresponding components.

***When submitting a form, you can print the data in the console log (IMPORTANT: printing onto console is not usual practice, you should use it only when you learning or debugging). This week it is only important to create a form, we will deal with validation in the coming weeks.*
